Hi, I’m Shiv. I’ve been doing this professionally since 2007 and for the joy of it since the early ’90s, using more languages and technologies than I can remember the names of at this point. I’ve put a number of projects here on GitHub in the last few years, and [I write about all sorts of things elsewhere](https://shivjm.blog/).

The important stuff: I’m a longtime Emacs user who’s painstakingly built [a development environment on Windows](https://github.com/shivjm-rc/configure-environment) through many experiments—though I happily use Linux too—and a staunch believer in an accessible, progressively enhanced web. (Don’t get me started about [displaying static text via JavaScript](https://shivjm.blog/your-javascript-only-website-sucks/).) I’m also obsessive about typography and, shall we say, [‘particular’ about my name](https://shivjm.name/).

Recently, I’ve worked with a lot of TypeScript (and a bit of vanilla JavaScript), Java, Python, and my current favourite, Rust. I’ve also been [exploring DevOps](https://shivjm.blog/the-death-and-rebirth-of-a-cluster/introduction/); the more interesting parts are [over on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/shivjm-www/infrastructure).

If you need to get in touch, you can [reach me via email](mailto:shiv@shivjm.in).
